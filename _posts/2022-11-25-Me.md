# Welcome 

## About me

Here I will post updates on my path into Data Science and Machine Learning, and other stories on what it's like for me to move from Product Management into Engineering. 

I have recently started the transition from Product Management into engineering and in particular Data Science and Machine Learning. 

I've been in tech for over 8 years, most of the time in a non-technical capacity, either in Project Management and more recently in Product Management. However, the whole time I felt my calling was really on the technical side. This summer I finally shook off the fear of taking a break from a comfortable career (and salary) in Product Management and undergo an intensive diploma course in Data Science and Machine Learning. 

Now looking at opportunities either in Data Science/Machine Learning either as a Data Scientist or Product Manager.
